                <strong>Milka Singh also known as Flying Sikh</strong> was an Indian track and field sprinter who was
                introduced to the sport while serving in the Indian Army.
                He is the only athlete to win gold at 400 metres at the Asian Games as well as the Commonwealth Games.
                He also won gold medals in the 1958 and 1962 Asian Games. He represented India in the 1956 Summer
                Olympics in Melbourne, the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome and the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.
                He was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian honour, in recognition of his sporting
                achievements.
                <br><br>
                His birthplace was Govindpura, a village 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Muzaffargarh city in Punjab
                Province, British India (now Muzaffargarh District, Pakistan).
                He was one of 15 siblings, eight of whom died before the Partition of India. He was orphaned during the
                Partition when his parents, a brother and two sisters were killed in the violence that ensued between
                the villagers and Muslims who tried to convert them.
                He witnessed these killings.
                Escaping the troubles in Punjab, where killings of Hindus and Sikhs were continuing, by moving to Delhi,
                India, in 1947, Singh lived for a short time with the family of his married sister and was briefly
                imprisoned at Tihar jail for travelling on a train without a ticket.
                His sister, Ishvar, sold some jewellery to obtain his release. He spent some time at a refugee camp in
                Purana Qila and at a resettlement colony in Shahdara, both in Delhi.
                <br><br>
                Singh became disenchanted with his life and considered becoming a dacoit but was instead persuaded by
                one of his brothers, Malkhan, to attempt recruitment to the Indian Army.
                He successfully gained entrance on his fourth attempt, in 1951, and while stationed at the Electrical
                Mechanical Engineering Centre in Secunderabad and he was introduced to athletics.
                He had run the 10 km distance to and from school as a child and was selected by the army for special
                training in athletics after finishing sixth in a compulsory cross-country run for new recruits.
                Singh has acknowledged how the army introduced him to sport, saying that "I came from a remote village,
                I didn't know what running was, or the Olympics".
